# 👋 Hi, I'm David Manh – Embedded Software Engineer

I'm an embedded systems engineer with solid experience in STM32, ESP32, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi. I focus on firmware development, rapid prototyping, and building reliable IoT solutions for real-world applications.

- 🔧 Specialized in: C/C++, FreeRTOS, Modbus, MQTT, PID control, and low-level driver development
- 🌐 Experienced with: REST APIs, MQTT brokers, and cloud integration (Blynk, Firebase, custom dashboards)
- 🛠️ Skilled in rapid prototyping using Arduino/ESP32, and creating proof-of-concept systems quickly
- 🧰 Comfortable with debugging hardware/software, optimizing performance, and writing clean, maintainable code
- 🚀 Passionate about delivering scalable, production-ready embedded systems

I'm currently open to freelance projects — whether it's developing custom firmware, integrating IoT devices, troubleshooting existing systems, or building complete prototypes from scratch. Feel free to reach out if you have a project in mind!
